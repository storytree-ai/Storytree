# Model-judge outcomes escalate by capability without laundering FAIL

**Outcome —** Structured outcomes route by the locked ladder: FAIL → build; advanced INCONCLUSIVE →
frontier; frontier INCONCLUSIVE → human exception; PASS → signable — never laundering FAIL into
human green.

## Guidance

- Author the classifier in `packages/model-judged-uat/src/escalation.ts`. Inputs: structured
  outcome, the criterion's required tier (`advanced`/`frontier`), and whether a stronger frontier
  judge is available. Output: a typed next action ∈ {`sign`, `build`, `escalate-frontier`,
  `escalate-human`} (names may settle at build — keep the four routes distinct) (ADR-0209 D4).
- **Locked ladder — do not reopen:**
  - PASS → `sign` (spine may sign the validated payload).
  - FAIL → `build` (implementation or rubric repair). **Never** `escalate-human`.
  - advanced INCONCLUSIVE → `escalate-frontier` when a frontier judge is available; otherwise HOLD
    honestly (unavailable tier holds — do not downgrade or invent a human path).
  - frontier INCONCLUSIVE → `escalate-human` (exceptional only).
- **FAIL laundering is a hard refuse.** Any attempt to map FAIL → human green / exceptional human
  must be rejected by the classifier, not warned.
- Human-declared criteria never enter this ladder (they go straight to operator attestation) —
  out of scope here; callers only invoke this for `model` witness results.
- Test-author ≠ code-author (`escalation.test.ts` → `escalation.ts`).

## Contracts (3)

1. **`escalation-routes-pass-fail-inconclusive`** — the four honest routes
   - **asserts —** PASS→sign; FAIL→build; advanced INCONCLUSIVE→escalate-frontier (frontier
     available); frontier INCONCLUSIVE→escalate-human (ADR-0209 D4).
2. **`escalation-unavailable-frontier-holds`** — no silent downgrade
   - **asserts —** advanced INCONCLUSIVE with no available frontier judge HOLDS (or equivalent
     typed hold) — not downgraded to advanced retry forever, not relabelled human (ADR-0209 D2/D4).
3. **`escalation-refuses-fail-to-human`** — FAIL cannot be laundered
   - **asserts —** FAIL never yields `escalate-human` or a signable human-green path; explicit
     override attempts are refused (ADR-0209 D4).
