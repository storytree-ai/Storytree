// phase-activity — the CLI-drive's phase WRITE for the red-green wisp (ADR-0048 §3 v2).
//
// The orchestrator stays PURE (ADR-0048 "No orchestrator impurity"): `proveUnit` only invokes an
// injected `onPhase` observer as it commits to each phase. The activity WRITE lives here in the
// drive — exactly where the initial `building` mark is written (node-build.ts) — so the gate never
// touches presence/activity. `phaseActivityWriter` builds that observer over an injected store:
// each phase appends a FRESH `building` work-event carrying the live phase. `inFlightBuilds()` reads
// the LATEST `building` row per unit (DISTINCT ON … ORDER BY seq DESC), so the newest phase wins and
// the wisp re-colours as the spine walks red→green.
//
// It is NOT a new lifecycle word (ADR-0048 "No new lifecycle word"): the event stays `building`; the
// phase rides as a field on the doc (WorkEventDoc.phase). And the write is ADVISORY: a store hiccup
// is swallowed so a board/DB failure can never fail the build it observes. It is also the build's
// ONLY board footprint besides the write-claim — a build run never writes session presence (ADR-0199).
