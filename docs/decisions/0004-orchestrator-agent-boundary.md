# ADR-0004: Orchestrator/agent boundary

**Status:** proposed (2026-06-04) — full rationale: v1 ADR-0003/0006/0008/0026.

> **Amended by [ADR-0011](0011-own-the-agent-loop-and-context-engineering.md)** — pi is
> replaced by an **owned agent loop** (`packages/agent`, superseding `pi-adapter`). Read
> "pi" / "pi-adapter" below as that owned loop; the boundary, single-model-import-site,
> orchestrator-only-driver, run≠node, and sole-fan-out rules are unchanged.

## Decision

Confine every model call behind one orchestrator-driven boundary, so model-unavailability is a *local* failure, never a system outage.

- pi is reached **only** through `packages/pi-adapter` — the sole place a model runtime is imported.
- **Only** `packages/orchestrator` drives `pi-adapter`. `packages/core` and `apps/studio` contain **no** agent invocation and no path to a model runtime.
- The **gate**, verdict computation, and event-log→rollup projection are pure functions of recorded evidence — they **never** call a model to reach a verdict.
- `pi-adapter` is a project-owned thin wrapper over pi's **documented** surface (`prompt`/`steer`/`followUp` + lifecycle stream + `edit` diffs); no third-party agent framework in the runtime path.
- **Run ≠ node:** a pi run/attempt is an execution event (many per node), never a new tree node.
- The orchestrator is the **sole fan-out point**; pi nodes never schedule child nodes (no agent-spawns-agent).
